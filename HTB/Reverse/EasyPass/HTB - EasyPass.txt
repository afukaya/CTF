1) Unzip the file EasyPass.zip. Password hackthebox.

2) Check the file with DIE to verify what is the EXE type.
	PE - Compiler -  Borland Delphi(7) -Windows Binary.

3) Open the binary with x32DBG to check how it works.
	- Execute until you get out NT Loader program loader - ntdll.dll
	- The code at EasyPass entry point has 5 calls.
	- Checks what each call does.
		45445B - Func1 - Aparently does nothing, check later if necessary.
		454467 - FuncB - Aparently does nothing, check later if necessary.
		45447F - FuncC - Aparently does nothing, check later if necessary.
		45448B - Main  - Calls user interface. - Break into.
		
	- Reset the execution and enter this funcion.
		- After some cycles, I noticed the program goes around a call at 45296E sub_452734 (Dialog).
		- sub_452734 makes two calls sub_45269C e sub_4530C4, one of them check the password.
	
	- Diving sub_45269C
		- 004526AF call <JMP.&PeekMessageA> after this call the program makes a series of conditional calls
		   for the fucntions bellow.
		- 004526D8 call dword ptr ds:[esi+D8]
		- 004526E2 call <easypass.sub_4525FC>
		- 004526F5 call <easypass.sub_4524F4>
		- 00452702 call <easypass.Func2C>
		0045270F | E8 BCFDFFFF              | call <easypass.Func2D>                  |
	
	Depois de muito sobre e desce com os breakpoints - 434501 - Captura o bot√£o check password.
